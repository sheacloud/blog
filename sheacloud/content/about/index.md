# About Me

I'm a programming enthusiast, currently supporting U.S. government agencies building out their enterprise cloud hosting environments. In my free time, I build tools in Go focused around AWS infrastructure automation and network analytics

## Background

I started coding from a young age, roughly around middle school. I was obsessed with understanding how different software worked, and at the time that revolved heavily around online games (Runescape, later on Minecraft). I got my programming start in running private servers for these games, being involved in the early days of "MoparScape" custom servers and minecraft servers for our friends to play on.

Towards the end of highschool I got involved in a school program, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA). This program ran national competitions focused around business, and one of my teachers encouraged me to enter the desktop application programming competition. I placed 1st at regionals and state for creating a library asset tracking system, with the standout feature being that it was a split client/server application rather than a standalone app (although don't ask about how I implemented this client-server communication ðŸ˜…)

## Current Work

Since then, I've been working with government agencies to migrate to the cloud. During that time, I played a large part in one of the first large implementations of AWS Transit Gateway and our team at General Dynamics was recognized by AWS as one of their [featured customers](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/customers/)

I've also been building some open source tools to address product gaps that I've come across over the past few years.
